## 🤔 FAQs

### Q: Do I need to implement everything?

### Q: How long will this take?
**A**: Path A = 1-2 weeks, Path B = 4-6 weeks, Path C = 2-3 months.

### Q: Can I pick features à la carte?
**A**: Yes! After completing Path A foundation, add any features you want.

### Q: Do I need a team for this?
