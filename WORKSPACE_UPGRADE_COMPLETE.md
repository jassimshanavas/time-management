# 🚀 WORKSPACE UPGRADE COMPLETE!
## Global Project-Centric Productivity

**Your app is now a unified Workspace platform!**

---

## 🏗️ **WHAT'S NEW:**

### **1. Global Workspace Switcher** 🔄
- Located in the **Header** (next to "TimeFlow").
- Switch context with **one click**.
- Choose between:
  - **🌍 Global View**: See everything in your life.
  - **👤 Personal**: See only items NOT linked to a project.
  - **📁 Specific Project**: Scope the entire app to one project.

### **2. App-Wide Context Awareness** 🧠
- Every module now "remembers" your selected workspace.
- **Switch to a Project** → Dashboard, Tasks, Notes, Goals, etc. all filter automatically!
- No more manual filtering in every list.

---

## 📱 **UPDATED MODULES:**

### **📊 Dashboard**
- **Stats updated**: Total tasks, completion rate, and time tracked reflect your workspace.
- **Lists updated**: Today's tasks and upcoming reminders belong only to the active context.

### **📋 Tasks & Kanban**
- **Auto-filtered**: Only shows relevant tasks.
- **Clean UI**: Local filters replaced by a global breadcrumb-style indicator.

### **📝 Notes & Documentation**
- **Knowledge Base**: Switch to a project to see its specific documentation and technical notes.

### **🎯 Goals & Milestones**
- **Strategic Focus**: Focus on project goals without personal goal clutter.

### **⏰ Time Tracking**
- **Project Billing**: See exactly how much time you've spent on the active project today.

### **📅 Calendar**
- **Focused Roadmap**: View a project-specific timeline of deadlines and milestones.

### **✨ Visual Board**
- **Scoped Brainstorming**: Load only current project tasks into your visual dependency graph.

## 💡 **HOW TO USE:**

1. **Look at the Top Bar**: Click the dropdown next to "TimeFlow".
2. **Select a Project**: (e.g., "Mobile App Redesign").
3. **Navigate**: Go to Tasks, then Notes, then Goals.
4. **Result**: You are in "Deep Work" mode for that project!
5. **Switch to Personal**: Clear the noise and focus on your non-work habits and goals.

## 🌟 **WHY THIS MATTERS:**

> "The project section feels like it is away from the app"

**This is fixed.** Projects are no longer a "section" — they are a **Context**. The entire app lives inside your projects when you want it to, and moves back to your global life when you're done.
